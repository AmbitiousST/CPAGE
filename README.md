# CPAGE
A small project for breaking captchas on some webpage.
The goal is to write a webbrowser extension to autofill captcha field in login form.
Maybe there will be even a documentation, but I wouldn't be so optimistic about it.
We are working to make the code work and then propably to look a bit less crapy.
